# Book Recommender System
This project is a book recommender system that uses both k-means clustering and content based filtering to suggest books to users. The system groups books into clusters based on their features and then recommends books that are similar to the userâ€™s preferences. The project also uses Scrapy to scrape book data from online sources and create a custom dataset for the system.
