He does not have friends—the two almond-shaped neurons located deep in his brain have seen to that—but his devoted mother and grandmother aren’t fazed by his condition. Their little home above his mother’s used bookstore is decorated with colorful post-it notes that remind him when to smile, when to say ""thank you,"" and when to laugh. Yunjae grows up content, even happy, with his small family in this quiet, peaceful space.<br><br>Then on Christmas Eve—Yunjae’s sixteenth birthday—everything changes. A shocking act of random violence shatters his world, leaving him alone and on his own. Struggling to cope with his loss, Yunjae retreats into silent isolation, until troubled teenager Gon arrives at his school and begins to bully Yunjae. <br><br>Against all odds, tormentor and victim learn they have more in common than they realized. Gon is stumped by Yunjae’s impassive calm, while Yunjae thinks if he gets to know the hotheaded Gon, he might learn how to experience true feelings. Drawn by curiosity, the two strike up a surprising friendship. As Yunjae begins to open his life to new people—including a girl at school—something slowly changes inside him. And when Gon suddenly finds his life in danger, it is Yunjae who will step outside of every comfort zone he has created to perhaps become a most unlikely hero. <br><br><em>The Emissary</em> meets <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime</em> in this poignant and triumphant story about how love, friendship, and persistence can change a life forever.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/contemporary"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Contemporary</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/young-adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Young Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/asian-literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Asian Literature</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mental-health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mental Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literary-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literary Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/asia"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Asia</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.20</div>",Almond,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">52,253<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

John Milton,"<span class=""Formatted"">John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.<br><br>Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/religion"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Religion</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.83</div>",Paradise Lost,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">153,596<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Allen Ginsberg,"<span class=""Formatted"">2014 Reprint of 1956 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. ""Howl"" is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1955, published as part of his 1956 collection of poetry titled ""Howl and Other Poems."" Ginsberg began work on ""Howl"" as early as 1954. ""Howl"" is considered to be one of the great works of American literature. It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation, which included Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. There is no foundation to the myth that ""Howl"" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense's case during the poem's obscenity trial, as detailed below. Upon the poem's release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore's manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene. Poems include: Howl -- Footnote To Howl -- A Supermarket in California -- Transcription of Organ Music -- Sunflower Sutra -- America -- In the Baggage Room at Greyhound; Earlier Poems: An Asphodel -- Song -- Wild Orphan -- In Back of the Real.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/lgbt"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">LGBT</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/queer"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Queer</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.13</div>",Howl and Other Poems,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">104,420<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Emily Dickinson,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>THE ONLY ONE-VOLUME EDITION CONTAINING ALL 1,775 OF EMILY DICKINSON’S POEMS</b><br><br>Only eleven of Emily Dickinson’s poems were published prior to her death in 1886; the startling originality of her work doomed it to obscurity in her lifetime. Early posthumously published collections-some of them featuring liberally “edited” versions of the poems-did not fully and accurately represent Dickinson’s bold experiments in prosody, her tragic vision, and the range of her intellectual and emotional explorations. Not until the 1955 publication of <i>The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, a three-volume critical edition compiled by Thomas H. Johnson, were readers able for the first time to assess, understand, and appreciate the whole of Dickinson’s extraordinary poetic genius.<br><br>This book, a distillation of the three-volume <i>Complete Poems</i>, brings together the original texts of all 1,775 poems that Emily Dickinson wrote.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/19th-century"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">19th Century</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classic-literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classic Literature</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.25</div>",The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">89,454<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Courtney Faye Taylor,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>Winner of the 2021 Cave Canem Poetry Prize, selected by Rachel Eliza Griffiths</b> <br><br>In her virtuosic debut, Courtney Faye Taylor explores the under-told history of the murder of Latasha Harlins—a fifteen-year-old Black girl killed by a Korean shop owner, Soon Ja Du, after being falsely accused of shoplifting a bottle of orange juice. Harlins’s murder and the following trial, which resulted in no prison time for Du, were inciting incidents of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising, and came to exemplify the long-fraught relationship between Black and Asian American communities in the United States. Through a collage-like approach to collective history and storytelling, Taylor’s poems present a profound look into the insidious points at which violence originates against—and between—women of color.<br><br><i>Concentrate</i> displays an astounding breadth of form and experimentation in found texts, micro-essays, and visual poems, merging worlds and bending time in order to interrogate inexorable encounters with American patriarchy and White supremacy manifested as sexual and racially charged violence. These poems demand absolute focus on Black womanhood’s relentless refusal to be unseen, even and especially when such luminosity exposes an exceptional vulnerability to harm and erasure. Taylor’s inventive, intimate book radically reconsiders the cost of memory, forging a path to a future rooted in solidarity and possibility. “Concentrate,” she writes. “We have decisions to make. Fire is that decision to make.”</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.91</div>",Concentrate: Poems,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">11<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Visiting all the fixtures of fashionable 21st century queer society—picnics, literary readings, health conferences, drag shows, punk houses, community accountability processes, Grindr hookups—<em>The Call-Out</em> also engages with pressing questions around economic precarity, sexual consent, racism in queer spaces, and feminist theory, in the service of asking what it takes to build, or destroy, a marginalized community.</p><p>A novel written in verse, <em>The Call-Out</em> recalls the Russian literary classic Eugene Onegin, but instead of 19th century Russian aristocrats crudely solved their disagreements with pistols, the participants in this rhyming drama have developed a more refined weapon, the online call-out, a cancel-culture staple. In this passionate tangle of modern relationships, where a barbed tweet can be as dangerous as the narrator’s bon-mots, Cat Fitzpatrick has fashioned a modern novel of manners that gives readers access to a vibrant cultural underground.</p></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/queer"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Queer</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/lgbt"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">LGBT</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/transgender"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Transgender</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.55</div>",The Call-Out,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">33<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Eileen Myles,"<span class=""Formatted"">An utterly unique collection composed by the award-winning poet, a global anthology of pieces from lesser-known classics by luminaries like Franz Kafka, Samuel R. Delany, and Gwendolyn Brooks to up-and-coming unpublished writers that examine pathos and feeling, giving a well-timed rehab to the word “pathetic” <br><br>“Literature is pathetic.” So claims Eileen Myles in their bold and bracing introduction to <em>Pathetic Literature</em>, an exuberant collection of pieces ranging from poetry to drama to prose to something in between, all of which explore those so-called “pathetic” or sensitive feelings around which lives are built and revolutions are incited.<br><br>Myles first reclaimed the word for a seminar they taught at the University of California San Diego, rescuing it from the derision into which it had slipped and restoring its original meaning of inspiring emotion or feeling, from the Ancient Greek rhetorical method <em>pathos</em>. Their reinvention of “pathetic” formed the bedrock for this anthology, which includes a breathtaking 105 contributors, encompassing titans of global literature like Robert Walser, Jorge Luis Borges, Rumi, and Gwendolyn Brooks, queer icons and revolutionaries like Dodie Bellamy, Samuel R. Delany, and Bob Flanagan, as well as the invigorating newness and excitement of writers on the rise, including Nicole Wallace, Precious Okoyomon, and Will Farris. Creative nonfiction by Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, Jack Halberstam, and Porochista Khakpour rubs shoulders with poetry by Natalie Diaz, Victoria Chang, Lucille Clifton, and Ariana Reines, all joined by prose from Chester Himes, Djuna Barnes, Chris Kraus, and Qiu Miaojin, among so many others. The result is a matchless anthology that is as much an ongoing dialogue as an essential compendium of queer, revolutionary, joyful, and always moving literature.<br><br>From confrontations with suffering, embarrassment, and disquiet, to the comforts and consolations of finding one’s familiar double in a poem, <em>Pathetic Literature</em> is a swarming taxonomy of ways to think differently and live pathetically on a polarized and fearful</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.30</div>",Pathetic Literature,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">10<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Joy Harjo,"<span class=""Formatted"">Over a long, influential career in poetry, Joy Harjo has been praised for her “warm, oracular voice” (John Freeman, <em>Boston Globe</em>) that speaks “from a deep and timeless source of compassion for all” (Craig Morgan Teicher, NPR).

Billy Collins,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>A collection of more than 125 small poems, all of them new, each a thought or observation compressed to its emotional essence--from the former United States Poet Laureate and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Aimless Love.</i></b><br><br><i>Whenever I open a book of poems, I tend to flip through looking for the small ones. Just as I might have trust in an abstract expressionist painter if I knew he or she could draw a credible chicken, I trust poets who can go short. --Billy Collins</i><br><br>You can spot a Billy Collins poem immediately. The amiable voice, the light touch, the sudden turn at the end. He puts the 'fun' back in profundity, says poet Alice Fulton. In his own words, his poems tend to start in Kansas and end in Oz.<br><br>Now America's favorite poet (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>) has found a new form for his unique poetic style: the small poem. Here Collins writes about his trademark themes of nature, animals, poetry, mortality, absurdity, and love--all in a handful of lines. Neither haiku nor limerick, the small poem pushes to an extreme poetry's famed power to condense emotional and conceptual meaning. Inspired by the small poetry of writers as diverse as William Carlos Williams, W.S. Merwin, Kay Ryan, and Charles Simic, and written with Collins's recognizable wit and wisdom, the more than 125 new poems of <i>Musical Tables</i> show one of our greatest poets channeling his unique voice into a new phase of his exceptional career.<br><br><i>3:00 AM</i><br><br><i>Only my hand</i><br><i>is asleep, </i><br><i>but it's a start.</i></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/humor"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Humor</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.03</div>",Musical Tables: Poems,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">180<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Franny Choi,"<span class=""Formatted""><strong>From acclaimed poet Franny Choi comes a poetry collection for the ends of worlds--past, present, and future. Choi's third book features poems about historical and impending apocalypses, alongside musings on our responsibilities to each other and visions for our collective survival.</strong><br><br>Many have called our time dystopian. But <em>The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On</em> reminds us that apocalypse has already come in myriad ways for marginalized peoples and calls us to imagine what will persist in the aftermaths.<br><br>With lyric and tonal dexterity, these poems spin backwards and forwards in time. They look into the collective psyche of our years in the pandemic and in the throes of anti-racist uprisings, while imagining other vectors, directions, and futures. Stories of survival collide across space and time--from Korean comfort women during World War II to children wandering a museum in the future. These poems explore narrative distances and queer linearity, investigating on microscopic scales before soaring towards the universal. Throughout, Choi grapples with where the individual fits within the strange landscapes of this apocalyptic world, with its violent and many-layered histories. In the process, she imagines what togetherness--between Black and Asian and other marginalized communities, between living organisms, between children of calamity and conquest--could look like. Bringing together Choi's signature speculative imagination with even greater musicality than her previous work, <em>The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On </em>ultimately charts new paths toward hope.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/poetry"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Poetry</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/lgbt"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">LGBT</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/queer"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Queer</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/lesbian"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Lesbian</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/queer-lit"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Queer Lit</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/dystopia"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Dystopia</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.25</div>","The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes on","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">262<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Carol S. Dweck,"<span class=""Formatted""><i>A newer edition of this book can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403537-mindset"">here.</a></i><br><br>After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a <i>fixed mindset</i> — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a <i>growth mindset</i> — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.<br><br>In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/psychology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Psychology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/self-help"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Self Help</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/business"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Business</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/personal-development"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Personal Development</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/education"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Education</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/leadership"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Leadership</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.08</div>",Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">126,791<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Jon Krakauer,"<span class=""Formatted"">A Story of Violent Faith<br><br>A multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.<br><br>Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.<br><br>Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.<br><br>Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism.

Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.<br><br><br>Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/religion"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Religion</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/islam"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Islam</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/spirituality"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Spirituality</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/reference"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Reference</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.38</div>",القرآن الكريم,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">64,211<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Karen Armstrong's superbly readable exploration of how the three dominant monotheistic religions of the world - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - have shaped and altered the conception of God is a tour de force. One of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, Armstrong traces the history of how men and women have perceived and experienced God, from the time of Abraham to the present. From classical philosophy and medieval mysticism to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the modern age of skepticism, Armstrong performs the near miracle of distilling the intellectual history of monotheism into one compelling volume.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/religion"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Religion</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/islam"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Islam</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/spirituality"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Spirituality</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/theology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Theology</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.88</div>","A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">47,936<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Mixing fiction with non-fiction, the campus novel with the lecture, THE NETANYAHUS is a wildly inventive, genre-bending comedy of blending, identity, and politics - 'An Account of A Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Incident in the History of a Very Famous Family' that finds Joshua Cohen at the height of his powers.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/jewish"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Jewish</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literary-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literary Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/novels"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Novels</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.84</div>",The Netanyahus,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">5,978<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
David Baddiel,"<span class=""Formatted""><i>Jews Don’t Count</i> is a book for people on the right side of history. People fighting the good fight against homophobia, disablism, transphobia and, particularly, racism.

In his unique combination of reasoning, polemic, personal experience and jokes, Baddiel argues that those who think of themselves as on the right side of history have often ignored the history of anti-Semitism. He outlines why and how, in a time of intensely heightened awareness of minorities, Jews don’t count as a real minority.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/jewish"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Jewish</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/race"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Race</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/essays"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Essays</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/social-justice"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Social Justice</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.31</div>",Jews Don't Count,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">6,621<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

After high school, he signed a billion-year contract and was admitted into Scientology’s elite inner circle, the Sea Organization. Brought to founder L. Ron Hubbard’s yacht and promised training in Hubbard’s most advanced techniques, Mike was instead put to work swabbing the decks.<br><br>Still, Rinder bought into the doctrine that his personal comfort was secondary to the higher purpose of Hubbard’s world-saving mission, swiftly rising through the ranks. In the 1980s, Rinder became Scientology’s international spokesperson and the head of its powerful Office of Special Affairs. He helped negotiate Scientology’s pivotal tax exemption from the IRS and engaged with the organization’s prominent celebrity members, including Tom Cruise, Lisa Marie Presley, and John Travolta.<br><br>Yet Rinder couldn’t shake a nagging feeling that something was amiss—Hubbard’s promises remained unfulfilled at his death, and his successor, David Miscavige, was a ruthless and vindictive man who did not hesitate to confine many top Scientologists, Mike among them, to a makeshift prison known as the Hole.<br><br>In 2007, at the age of fifty-two, Rinder finally escaped Scientology. Overnight, he became one of the organization’s biggest public enemies. He was followed, hacked, spied on, and tracked.

Charlie N. Holmberg,"<span class=""Formatted"">Rhode Island, 1846. Estranged from his family, writer Merritt Fernsby is surprised when he inherits a remote estate in the Narragansett Bay. Though the property has been uninhabited for more than a century, Merritt is ready to call it home—until he realizes he has no choice. With its doors slamming shut and locking behind him, Whimbrel House is not about to let Merritt leave. Ever.<br><br>Hulda Larkin of the Boston Institute for the Keeping of Enchanted Rooms has been trained in taming such structures in order to preserve their historical and magical significance. She understands the dangers of bespelled homes given to tantrums. She advises that it’s in Merritt’s best interest to make Whimbrel House their ally. To do that, she’ll need to move in, too.<br><br>Prepared as she is with augury, a set of magic tools, and a new staff trained in the uncanny, Hulda’s work still proves unexpectedly difficult. She and Merritt grow closer as the investigation progresses, but the house’s secrets run deeper than they anticipated. And the sentient walls aren’t their only concern—something outside is coming for the enchantments of Whimbrel House, and it could be more dangerous than what rattles within.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/magic"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Magic</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.36</div>",Keeper of Enchanted Rooms,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">7,329<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Richard Dawkins,"<span class=""Formatted"">""The Selfish Gene"" caused a wave of excitement among biologists and the general public when it was first published in 1976.

Time has confirmed its significance.

Stephen Hawking,"<span class=""Formatted"">In the ten years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/physics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Physics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/astronomy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Astronomy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.20</div>",A Brief History of Time,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">389,628<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
David Graeber,"<span class=""Formatted"">A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.<br><br>For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.<br><br>Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.<br><br>The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/anthropology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Anthropology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sociology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sociology</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.22</div>",The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">9,257<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

  <strong>The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger</strong>
</p><p>The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.</p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive—until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.</p><p>But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come.</p><p>Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, <em>The Radium Girls</em> fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives.</p></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/feminism"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Feminism</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.14</div>",The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">120,384<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Susan Cain,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>In her new masterpiece, the author of the bestselling phenomenon <i>Quiet</i> reveals the power of a bittersweet outlook on life, and why we’ve been so blind to its value.</b><br><br>With <i>Quiet</i>, Susan Cain urged our society to cultivate space for the undervalued, indispensable introverts among us, thereby revealing an untapped power hidden in plain sight. Now she employs the same mix of research, storytelling, and memoir to explore why we experience sorrow and longing, and the surprising lessons these states of mind teach us about creativity, compassion, leadership, spirituality, mortality, and love.<br> <br>Bittersweetness is a tendency to states of longing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy when beholding beauty. It recognizes that light and dark, birth and death—bitter and sweet—are forever paired. A song in a minor key, an elegiac poem, or even a touching television commercial all can bring us to this sublime, even holy, state of mind—and, ultimately, to greater kinship with our fellow humans.<br> <br>But bittersweetness is not, as we tend to think, just a momentary feeling or event. It’s also a way of being, a storied heritage. Our artistic and spiritual traditions—amplified by recent scientific and management research—teach us its power.<br> <br>Cain shows how a bittersweet state of mind is the quiet force that helps us transcend our personal and collective pain. If we don’t acknowledge our own sorrows and longings, she says, we can end up inflicting them on others via abuse, domination, or neglect. But if we realize that all humans know—or will know—loss and suffering, we can turn toward each other. And we can learn to transform our own pain into creativity, transcendence, and connection.<br> <br>At a time of profound discord and personal anxiety, <i>Bittersweet</i> brings us together in deep and unexpected ways.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/psychology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Psychology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/self-help"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Self Help</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mental-health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mental Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.02</div>",Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">10,016<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Anna Lembke,"<span class=""Formatted"">This book is about pleasure. It's also about pain. Most important, it's about how to find the delicate balance between the two, and why now more than ever finding balance is essential. We're living in a time of unprecedented access to high-reward, high-dopamine stimuli: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting... The increased numbers, variety, and potency is staggering. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation. As such we've all become vulnerable to compulsive overconsumption.<br><br>In <i>Dopamine Nation</i>, Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist and author, explores the exciting new scientific discoveries that explain why the relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to pain...and what to do about it.

Stephanie Foo,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>A searing memoir of reckoning and healing by acclaimed journalist Stephanie Foo, </b> <b>investigating the little-understood science behind complex PTSD and how it has shaped her</b> <b>life</b><br><i><br>""Every cell in my body is filled with the code of generations of trauma, of death, of birth, of</i> <i>migration, of history that I cannot understand. . . . I want to have words for what my bones</i> <i>know.""</i><br><br>By age thirty, Stephanie Foo was successful on paper: She had her dream job as an award-winning radio producer at <i>This American Life </i>and a loving boyfriend. But behind her office door, she was having panic attacks and sobbing at her desk every morning. After years of questioning what was wrong with herself, she was diagnosed with complex PTSD--a condition that occurs when trauma happens continuously, over the course of years.<br><br>Both of Foo's parents abandoned her when she was a teenager, after years of physical and verbal abuse and neglect. She thought she'd moved on, but her new diagnosis illuminated the way her past continued to threaten her health, relationships, and career. She found limited resources to help her, so Foo set out to heal herself, and to map her experiences onto the scarce literature about C-PTSD.<br><br>In this deeply personal and thoroughly researched account, Foo interviews scientists and psychologists and tries a variety of innovative therapies. She returns to her hometown of San Jose, California, to investigate the effects of immigrant trauma on the community, and she uncovers family secrets in the country of her birth, Malaysia, to learn how trauma can be inherited through generations. Ultimately, she discovers that you don't move on from trauma--but you can learn to move with it.<br><br>Powerful, enlightening, and hopeful, <i> What My Bones Know </i>is a brave narrative that reckons with the hold of the past over the present, the mind over the body--and examines one woman's ability to reclaim agency from her trauma.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/psychology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Psychology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mental-health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mental Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/self-help"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Self Help</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.55</div>",What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">9,648<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Gabrielle Stanley Blair,"<span class=""Formatted"">In <i>Ejaculate Responsibly</i>, Gabrielle Blair offers a provocative reframing of the abortion issue in post-<i>Roe</i> America. In a series of 28 brief arguments, she deftly makes the case for moving the abortion debate away from controlling and legislating women’s bodies and instead directs the focus on men’s lack of accountability in preventing unwanted pregnancies.<br><br>Highly readable, accessible, funny, and unflinching, Blair builds her argument by walking readers through the basics of fertility (men are 50 times more fertile than woman), the unfair burden placed on women when it comes to preventing pregnancy (90% of the birth control market is for women), the wrongheaded stigmas around birth control for men (condoms make sex less pleasurable, vasectomies are scary and emasculating), and the counterintuitive reality that men, who are fertile 100% of the time, take little to no responsibility for preventing pregnancy. <br><br> The result is a compelling and convincing case for placing the responsibility—and burden—of preventing unwanted pregnancies away from women and onto men.<i></i></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/feminism"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Feminism</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/social-justice"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Social Justice</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/womens"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Womens</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.67</div>",Ejaculate Responsibly: A Whole New Way to Think About Abortion,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">898<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

George Orwell,"<span class=""Formatted"">The new novel by George Orwell is the major work towards which all his previous writing has pointed. Critics have hailed it as his ""most solid, most brilliant"" work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence, it is in every sense timely. The scene is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well, war is peace.<br><br>To Winston Smith, a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short), come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia, whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading, ""I love you."" The other is O'Brien, who tells him, ""We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."" The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and, against his own desires and instincts, ultimately betrays the other, makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.<br><br>Alternate cover edition can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36526988-nineteen-eighty-four"">here</a>.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/dystopia"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Dystopia</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/novels"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Novels</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.19</div>",1984,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">4,008,400<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Orson Scott Card,"<span class=""Formatted"">Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br><br>But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/young-adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Young Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science-fiction-fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science Fiction Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/dystopia"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Dystopia</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/war"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">War</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.31</div>",Ender's Game,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,279,726<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt<br><br>Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly.

Susan Cain,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>The book that started the Quiet Revolution<br></b><br>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. <br><br>In <i>Quiet, </i>Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture.

Mark Manson,"<span class=""Formatted""><i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738</i><br><br>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br><br>For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br><br>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br><br>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/self-help"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Self Help</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/psychology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Psychology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/personal-development"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Personal Development</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/business"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Business</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.91</div>",The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">862,355<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Dalai Lama XIV,"<span class=""Formatted"">Nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling. And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and an increasingly popular speaker and statesman. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that ""the very motion of our life is towards happiness."" How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement.

H.G. Bissinger,"<span class=""Formatted""><div>Return once again to the enduring account of life in the Mojo lane, to the Permian Panthers of Odessa -- the winningest high school football team in Texas history. Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business.In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true. With frankness and compassion, Bissinger chronicles one of the Panthers' dramatic seasons and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires-and sometimes shatters-the teenagers who wear the Panthers' uniforms. Includes Reader's Group Guide inside. Now a major motion picture starring Billy Bob Thorton.</div></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sports"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sports</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/football"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Football</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/journalism"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Journalism</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.14</div>","Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">56,343<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Daniel James Brown,"<span class=""Formatted"">For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's <i>Seabiscuit</i> and <i>Unbroken</i>, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.<p>Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.</p><p>The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.</p><p>Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, <i>The Boys in the Boat</i> is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's <i>The Amateurs</i>.</p></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sports"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sports</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/book-club"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Book Club</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.37</div>",The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">266,475<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Christopher McDougall,"<span class=""Formatted"">Full of incredible characters, amazing athletic achievements, cutting-edge science, and, most of all, pure inspiration, <i>Born to Run</i> is an epic adventure that began with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.<br><br>Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.<br><br>With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. <i>Born to Run</i> is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sports"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sports</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fitness"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fitness</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adventure"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adventure</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.30</div>","Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">195,062<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Nathan Chen,"<span class=""Formatted"">In this exhilarating memoir, three-time World Champion and Olympic gold-medalist Nathan Chen tells the story of his remarkable journey to success, reflecting on his life as a Chinese American figure skater and the joys and challenges he has experienced--including the tremendous sacrifices he and his family made, and the physical and emotional pain he endured.<br><br>When three-year-old Nathan Chen tried on his first pair of figure skates, magic happened. But the odds of this young boy--one of five children born to Chinese immigrants--competing and making it into the top echelons of figure skating were daunting. Chen's family didn't have the resources or access to pay for expensive coaches, rink time, and equipment. But Nathan's mother, Hetty Wang, refused to fail her child. Recognizing his tremendous talent and passion, she stepped up as his coach, making enormous sacrifices to give Nathan the opportunity to compete in this exclusive world.<br><br>That dedication eventually paid off at the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing, where Chen--reverently known as the Quad King--won gold, becoming the first Asian-American man to stand at the highest podium in figure skating. In this moving and inspiring memoir Chen opens up for the first time, chronicling everything it took to pursue his dreams. Bolstered by his unwavering passion and his family's unconditional support, Chen reveals the most difficult times he endured, and how he overcame each obstacle-from his disappointment at the 2018 Olympic Games, to competing during a global pandemic, to the extreme physical and mental toll the sport demands.<br><br>Pulling back the curtain on the figure skating world and the Olympics, Chen reveals what it was really like at the Beijing Games and competing on the US team in the same city his parents had left--and his grandmother still lived. Poignant and unfiltered, told in his own words, One Jump at a Time is the story of one extraordinary young man--and a testament to the love of a family and the power of persistence, grit, and passion.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/figure-skating"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Figure Skating</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sports"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sports</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.35</div>",One Jump at a Time: My Story,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">52<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Finally, after the birth of his son Zachary, Sutter came to see that he needed to live a life of truth. Not just for himself, but for Zach as well. The truth included coming out at forty, getting divorced while his son was an infant, and trying to readjust to being who he was born to be.<br><br>Throughout all the turmoil, Sutter’s best friend, Watley McCutcheon, stood by his side. Watley understood how difficult breaking free could be. He had done it many years ago when they were still on the same college hockey team. Sutter always admired Wat’s bravery.

When he overhears friend and fellow agent Skye Delaney discussing a new case involving her missing sister and a mysterious cult, he offers himself as backup.

But with her mother gone, a grieving Lillian is rudderless and desperate—the work has dried up and a looming scandal has left her entirely without a safe haven. So when she stumbles upon an employment opportunity at the Frick mansion—a building that, ironically, bears her own visage—Lillian jumps at the chance. But the longer she works as a private secretary to the imperious and demanding Helen Frick, the daughter and heiress of industrialist and art patron Henry Clay Frick, the more deeply her life gets intertwined with that of the family—pulling her into a tangled web of romantic trysts, stolen jewels, and family drama that runs so deep, the stakes just may be life or death.<br><br>Nearly fifty years later, mod English model Veronica Weber has her own chance to make her career—and with it, earn the money she needs to support her family back home—within the walls of the former Frick residence, now converted into one of New York City’s most impressive museums. But when she—along with a charming intern/budding art curator named Joshua—is dismissed from the Vogue shoot taking place at the Frick Collection, she chances upon a series of hidden messages in the museum: messages that will lead her and Joshua on a hunt that could not only solve Veronica’s financial woes, but could finally reveal the truth behind a decades-old murder in the infamous Frick family.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/new-york"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">New York</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.91</div>",The Magnolia Palace,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">44,544<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Ron Chernow,"<span class=""Formatted""><i>An alternate cover edition can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603800-alexander-hamilton"">here.</a></i><br><br>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.<br><br>In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, <b>
  <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>
</b> is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”<br><br>Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.<br><br>Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, <b>
  <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>
</b> will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american-history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.21</div>",Alexander Hamilton,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">165,251<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
David McCullough,"<span class=""Formatted"">The enthralling, often surprising story of John Adams, one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.<br><br>In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. <br><br>Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. <br><br>As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. <br><br>Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. <br><br>At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. <br><br>Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. <br><br>It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. <br><br>This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american-history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/presidents"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Presidents</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.06</div>",John Adams,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">348,115<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Laura Hillenbrand,"<span class=""Formatted"">On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.<br><br>The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.<br><br>Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/world-war-ii"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">World War II</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/war"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">War</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.37</div>","Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">878,516<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition?

Anne Frank,"<span class=""Formatted"">Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. <br><br>In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.<br>--back cover</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/holocaust"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Holocaust</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.18</div>",The Diary of a Young Girl,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">3,367,673<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Walter Isaacson,"<span class=""Formatted"">Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/business"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Business</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/technology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Technology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.16</div>",Steve Jobs,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,154,742<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Ben Macintyre,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>The definitive and surprising true story of one of history’s most notorious prisons—and the remarkable cast of POWs who tried relentlessly to escape their captors, from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Spy and the Traitor</i></b><br><br>In this gripping narrative, Ben Macintyre tackles one of the most famous prison stories in history and makes it utterly his own. During World War II, the German army used the towering Colditz Castle to hold the most defiant Allied prisoners. For four years, these prisoners of the castle tested its walls and its guards with ingenious escape attempts that would become legend.<br><br>But as Macintyre shows, the story of Colditz was about much more than escape. Its population represented a society in miniature, full of heroes and traitors, class conflicts and secret alliances, and the full range of human joy and despair. In Macintyre’s telling, Colditz’s most famous names—like the indomitable Pat Reid—share glory with lesser known but equally remarkable characters like Indian doctor Birendranath Mazumdar whose ill treatment, hunger strike, and eventual escape read like fiction; Florimond Duke, America’s oldest paratrooper and least successful secret agent; and Christopher Clayton Hutton, the brilliant inventor employed by British intelligence to manufacture covert escape aids for POWs.<br><br>Prisoners of the Castle traces the war’s arc from within Colditz’s stone walls, where the stakes rose as Hitler’s war machine faltered and the men feared that liberation would not come soon enough to spare them a grisly fate at the hands of the Nazis. Bringing together the wartime intrigue of his acclaimed <i>Operation Mincemeat</i> and keen psychological portraits of his bestselling true-life spy stories, Macintyre has breathed new life into one of the greatest war stories ever told.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/war"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">War</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/world-war-ii"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">World War II</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.33</div>","Prisoners of the Castle: An Epic Story of Survival and Escape from Colditz, the Nazis' Fortress Prison","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,161<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Anderson Cooper,"<span class=""Formatted"">New York Times bestselling author and journalist Anderson Cooper teams with New York Times bestselling historian and novelist Katherine Howe to chronicle the rise and fall of a legendary American dynasty—his mother’s family, the Vanderbilts.<br><br>When eleven-year-old Cornelius Vanderbilt began to work on his father’s small boat ferrying supplies in New York Harbor at the beginning of the nineteenth century, no one could have imagined that one day he would, through ruthlessness, cunning, and a pathological desire for money, build two empires—one in shipping and another in railroads—that would make him the richest man in America. His staggering fortune was fought over by his heirs after his death in 1877, sowing familial discord that would never fully heal. Though his son Billy doubled the money left by “the Commodore,” subsequent generations competed to find new and ever more extraordinary ways of spending it. By 2018, when the last Vanderbilt was forced out of The Breakers—the seventy-room summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island, that Cornelius’s grandson and namesake had built—the family would have been unrecognizable to the tycoon who started it all.<br><br>Now, the Commodore’s great-great-great-grandson Anderson Cooper, joins with historian Katherine Howe to explore the story of his legendary family and their outsized influence. Cooper and Howe breathe life into the ancestors who built the family’s empire, basked in the Commodore’s wealth, hosted lavish galas, and became synonymous with unfettered American capitalism and high society. Moving from the hardscrabble wharves of old Manhattan to the lavish drawing rooms of Gilded Age Fifth Avenue, from the ornate summer palaces of Newport to the courts of Europe, and all the way to modern-day New York, Cooper and Howe wryly recount the triumphs and tragedies of an American dynasty unlike any other.<br><br>Written with a unique insider’s viewpoint, this is a rollicking, quintessentially American history as remarkable as the family it so vividly captures.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.83</div>",Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">26,484<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Tom Segura,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>From Tom Segura, the massively successful stand-up comedian and co-host of chart-topping podcasts “2 Bears 1 Cave” and “Your Mom’s House,” hilarious real-life stories of parenting, celebrity encounters, youthful mistakes, misanthropy, and so much more.<br> </b><br>Tom Segura is known for his twisted takes and irreverent comedic voice. But after a few years of crazy tours and churning out podcasts weekly, all while parenting two young children, he desperately needs a second to himself. It’s not that he hates his friends and family — he’s not a monster — he’s just beat, which is why his son’s (ruthless) first full sentence, “I’d like to play alone, please,” has since become his mantra. <br> <br>In this collection of stories, Tom combines his signature curmudgeonly humor with a revealing look at some of the ridiculous situations that shaped him and the ludicrous characters who always seem to seek him out. The stories feature hilarious anecdotes about Tom's time on the road, including some surreal encounters with celebrities at airports; his unfiltered South American family; the trials and tribulations of parenting young children with bizarrely morbid interests; and, perhaps most memorably, experiences with his dad who, like any good Baby Boomer father, loves to talk about his bowel movements and share graphic Vietnam stories at inappropriate moments. All of this is enough to make anyone want some peace and quiet. <br> <br>I’D LIKE TO PLAY ALONE, PLEASE will have readers laughing out loud and nodding in agreement with Segura's message: in a world where everyone is increasingly insane, sometimes you just need to be alone.  </span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/humor"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Humor</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/comedy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Comedy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/essays"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Essays</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.10</div>","I'd Like to Play Alone, Please: Essays","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">5,346<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Though she claimed she thought he was a prowler, few believed the woman who had risen from charismatic showgirl to popular socialite. Everyone had something to say about the scorching scandal afflicting one of the most rich and famous families of New York City, but no one was more obsessed with the tale than Truman Capote.<br><br>Acclaimed for his bestselling nonfiction book 'In Cold Blood', Capote was looking for new material and followed the scandal from beginning to end. Like Ann, he too had ascended from nobody to toast of the town, but he always felt like an outsider, even among the exclusive coterie of high society women who adored him. He decided the story of Ann’s turbulent marriage would be the basis of his masterpiece — a novel about the dysfunction and sordid secrets revealed to him by his high society “swans”—never thinking that it would eventually lead to Ann’s suicide and his own scandalous downfall.<br><br>“A 20th-century morality tale of enduring fascination” (Laura Thompson, author of 'The Heiresses', 'Deliberate Cruelty' is a haunting cross between true crime and literary history that is perfect for fans of 'Furious Hours', 'Empty Mansions', and 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/true-crime"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">True Crime</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/crime"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Crime</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Thriller</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.79</div>","Deliberate Cruelty: Truman Capote, the Millionaire's Wife, and the Murder of the Century","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">254<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

The king has achieved fame as the world's first individual and the first monotheist, but others have seen him as an incestuous tyrant who nearly ruined the kingdom he ruled. The gold funerary mask of his son Tutankhamun and the painted bust of his wife Nefertiti are the most recognizable artifacts from all of ancient Egypt. But who are Akhenaten and Nefertiti? And what can we actually say about rulers who lived more than three thousand years ago?<br><br>November 2022 marks the centennial of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun and although ""King Tut"" is a household name, his nine-year rule pales in comparison to the revolutionary reign of his parents. Akhenaten and Nefertiti became gods on earth by transforming Egyptian solar worship, innovating in art and urban design, and merging religion and politics in ways never attempted before. <br><br>Combining fascinating scholarship, detective suspense, and adventurous thrills, <i>Egypt's Golden Couple</i> is a journey through excavations, museums, hieroglyphic texts, and stunning artifacts.

Andrew Morton,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling biographer Andrew Morton provides the definitive, most comprehensive account of Queen Elizabeth II's legendary reign. </b><br><br> Painfully shy, Elizabeth Windsor’s personality was well suited to her youthful ambition of living quietly in the country, raising a family, and caring for her dogs and horses. But when her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated, she became heir to the throne—embarking on a journey that would test her as a woman and queen.<br><br> Ascending to the throne at only 25, this self-effacing monarch navigated endless setbacks, family conflict, and occasional triumphs throughout her 70 years as the Queen of England. As her mettle was tested, she endeavored to keep the monarchy relevant culturally, socially, and politically, often in the face of resistance from inside the institution itself. And yet the greatest challenges she faced were often inside her own family, forever under intense scrutiny; from rumors about her husband’s infidelity, her sister’s marital breakdown, Princess Diana’s tragic death, to the recent departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.<br><br> Now in <i>The Queen</i>, renowned biographer Andrew Morton takes an in-depth look at Britain’s longest reigning monarch, exploring the influence Queen Elizabeth had on both Britain and the rest of the world for much of the last century. From leading a nation struggling to restore itself after the devastation of the second World War to navigating the divisive political landscape of the present day, Queen Elizabeth was a reluctant but resolute queen. This is the story of a woman of unflagging self-discipline who will long be remembered as mother and grandmother to Great Britain, and one of the greatest sovereigns of the modern era.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.10</div>",The Queen: Her Life,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">173<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

The people, places, and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist. <i>Surrender</i> is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress ... With a fair amount of fun along the way."" --Bono<br><br>As one of the music world's most iconic artists and the cofounder of the organizations ONE and (RED), Bono's career has been written about extensively. But in <i>Surrender</i>, it's Bono who picks up the pen, writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has shared it with. In his unique voice, Bono takes us from his early days growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when he was fourteen, to U2's unlikely journey to become one of the world's most influential rock bands, to his more than twenty years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. Writing with candor, self-reflection, and humor, Bono opens the aperture on his life--and the family, friends, and faith that have sustained, challenged, and shaped him.<br><br><i>Surrender</i>'s subtitle, <i>40 Songs, One Story, </i> is a nod to the book's forty chapters, which are each named after a U2 song.

In <i>The Light We Carry,</i> she opens a frank and honest dialogue with readers, considering the questions many of us wrestle with: How do we build enduring and honest relationships?

With trademark humor, candor, and compassion, she also explores issues connected to race, gender, and visibility, encouraging readers to work through fear, find strength in community, and live with boldness.<br> <br>“When we are able to recognize our own light, we become empowered to use it,” writes Michelle Obama.

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.<br><br>The Challenge<br>Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. <br><br>But what about the company that is not born with great DNA?

Simon Sinek,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>Why do you do what you do?</b><br><br>Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?<br><br>People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all <i>started with why</i>. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.<br><br>In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.<br><br>Any organization can explain <i>what</i> it does; some can explain <i>how</i> they do it; but very few can clearly articulate <i>why</i>. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?<br><br>Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.<br><br>Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.

We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and “life hacks” to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.<br><br>Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management.

Lauren Weisberger,"<span class=""Formatted"">A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. <br>Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of ""Runway ""magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts ""Prada! Armani! Versace!"" at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. <br>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/chick-lit"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Chick Lit</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/contemporary"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Contemporary</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/humor"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Humor</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult Fiction</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.78</div>",The Devil Wears Prada,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">848,626<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

J.R.R. Tolkien,"<span class=""Formatted"">In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.<br>Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A.

Marjane Satrapi,"<span class=""Formatted"">In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.<br><br>Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/graphic-novels"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Graphic Novels</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/comics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Comics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/iran"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Iran</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.26</div>",Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">189,122<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Art Spiegelman,"<span class=""Formatted"">On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as “the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust” (Wall Street Journal) and “the first masterpiece in comic book history” (The New Yorker).<br><br>The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler’s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father’s story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).<br><br>Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/graphic-novels"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Graphic Novels</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/comics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Comics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.56</div>",The Complete Maus,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">188,555<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br><br>Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br><br>The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.<br><br><i>For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth"">Alternate Cover Edition</a></i><br></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/medieval"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Medieval</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.33</div>",The Pillars of the Earth,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">717,600<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.<br><br>Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.<br><br>Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.<br><br>In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. <br>(jacket flap)<br><br><i>Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44768927.here"" title=""here"">here</a></i></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/contemporary"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Contemporary</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.47</div>",The Help,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">2,520,913<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Amanda Skenandore,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>The glamorous world of a silent film star’s wife abruptly crumbles when she’s forcibly quarantined at the Carville Lepers Home in this page-turning story of courage, resilience, and reinvention set in 1920s Louisiana and Los Angeles. Based on little-known history, this timely book will strike a chord with readers of Fiona Davis, Tracey Lange, and Marie Benedict.</b><br><br>Based on the true story of America’s only leper colony, The Second Life of Mirielle West brings vividly to life the Louisiana institution known as Carville, where thousands of people were stripped of their civil rights, branded as lepers, and forcibly quarantined throughout the entire 20th century. <br><br>For Mirielle West, a 1920’s socialite married to a silent film star, the isolation and powerlessness of the Louisiana Leper Home is an unimaginable fall from her intoxicatingly chic life of bootlegged champagne and the star-studded parties of Hollywood’s Golden Age. When a doctor notices a pale patch of skin on her hand, she’s immediately branded a leper and carted hundreds of miles from home to Carville, taking a new name to spare her family and famous husband the shame that accompanies the disease.<br><br>At first she hopes her exile will be brief, but those sent to Carville are more prisoners than patients and their disease has no cure. Instead she must find community and purpose within its walls, struggling to redefine her self-worth while fighting an unchosen fate.<br><br>As a registered nurse, Amanda Skenandore’s medical background adds layers of detail and authenticity to the experiences of patients and medical professionals at Carville – the isolation, stigma, experimental treatments, and disparate community. A tale of repulsion, resilience, and the Roaring ‘20s, The Second Life of Mirielle West is also the story of a health crisis in America’s past, made all the more poignant by the author’s experiences during another, all-too-recent crisis.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult Fiction</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.27</div>",The Second Life of Mirielle West,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">16,466<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Lucrezia, third daughter of the grand duke, is comfortable with her obscure place in the palazzo: free to wonder at its treasures, observe its clandestine workings, and to devote herself to her own artistic pursuits.

In the court’s eyes, she has one duty: to provide the heir who will shore up the future of the Ferranese dynasty. Until then, for all of her rank and nobility, the new duchess’s future hangs entirely in the balance.<br> <br>Full of the drama and verve with which she illuminated the Shakespearean canvas of Hamnet, Maggie O’Farrell brings the world of Renaissance Italy to jewel-bright life, and offers an unforgettable portrait of a resilient young woman’s battle for her very survival.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/italy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Italy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literary-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literary Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.21</div>",The Marriage Portrait,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">18,333<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

For generations, the true story was ignored, covered up, and diminished by those in power and in a position to preserve a racist status quo.

A collage of Black lives one hundred years after the massacre shows how things have changed and how they have not. Requiem for the Massacre includes interviews from survivors of the massacre and their descendants, as well as research from historical archives at the Greenwood Cultural Center, the University of Tulsa, and other sources, culminating in current efforts to excavate an empty sunken patch of land believed to be the site of an unmarked mass grave of victims of the massacre.<br> <br>As the United States is in the throes of Black Lives Matter demonstrations spurned by the killing of George Floyd, and as Tulsa heads into the next one hundred years, Young's own reflections thread together the stories of a community trying to heal and trying to hope.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/race"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Race</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/social-justice"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Social Justice</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american-history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American History</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.40</div>","Requiem for the Massacre: A Black History on the Conflict, Hope, and Fallout of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">10<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

The tale of a self-taught operative and his high-stakes attempt subvert the North Korean regime.</b><br><br>In the early 2000s, Adrian Hong was a soft-spoken Yale undergraduate looking for his place in the world. After reading a harrowing account of life inside North Korea, he realized he had found a cause so pressing that he was ready to devote his life to it.<br><br>What began as a trip down the safe and well-worn path of organizing soon morphed into something more dangerous. Hong journeyed to China, outwitting Chinese security services as he helped asylum-seeking North Koreans escape across the border. Meanwhile, Hong's secret organization, Cheollima Civil Defense (later renamed Free Joseon), began tracking the North Korean government's activities, and its volatile third-generation ruler, Kim Jong-un. Free Joseon targeted North Korean diplomats who might be persuaded to defect, while drawing up plans for a government-in-exile. After the shocking broad-daylight assassination in 2017 of Kim Jong-nam, the dictator's older brother, Hong, along with U.S. Marine veteran Christopher Ahn, helped ferry Kim Jong-nam's family to safety. Then Hong took the group a step further.

Stephen King,"<span class=""Formatted"">Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.<br><br>On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.<br><br>Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""<br><br>Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/horror"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Horror</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Thriller</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fantasy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/paranormal"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Paranormal</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/supernatural"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Supernatural</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.12</div>",Doctor Sleep,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">234,612<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Ted Conover,"<span class=""Formatted""><b> From Pulitzer Prize finalist and National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author Ted Conover, a passage through an America lived wild and off the grid.</b><br><br>In May 2017, Ted Conover went to Colorado to explore firsthand a rural way of life that is about living cheaply, on your own land--and keeping clear of the mainstream. The failed subdivisions of the enormous San Luis Valley make this possible. Five-acre lots on the high prairie can be had for five thousand dollars, sometimes less. But along with independence and stunning views come fierce winds, neighbors with criminal pasts, and minimal government and medical services.<br><br>Conover volunteered for a local group trying to prevent homelessness during the bitter winters. He encountered an unexpected diversity: veterans with PTSD, families homeschooling, addicts young and old, gay people, people of color, lovers of guns and marijuana, people with social anxiety--most of them spurning charity and aiming, and sometimes failing, to be self-sufficient. And more than a few predicting they'll be the last ones standing when society collapses.<br><br>Conover bought his own five acres and immersed himself for parts of four years in the often contentious culture of the far margins. He found many who dislike the government but depend on its subsidies; who love their space but nevertheless find themselves in each other's business; who are generous but wary of thieves; who endure squalor but appreciate beauty. In their struggles to survive and get along, they tell us about an America riven by difference where the edges speak more and more loudly to the mainstream.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/sociology"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Sociology</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Historical</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">American</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/cultural"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Cultural</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.23</div>",Cheap Land Colorado: Off-Gridders at America's Edge,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">100<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Mary-Alice Daniel,"<span class=""Formatted""><strong>A poetic coming-of-age memoir that probes the legacies and myths of family, race, and religion--from Nigeria to England to America</strong><br><br>Mary-Alice Daniel's family moved from West Africa to England when she was a very young girl, leaving behind the vivid culture of her native land in the Nigerian savanna. They arrived to a blanched, cold world of prim suburbs and unfamiliar customs. So began her family's series of travels across three continents in search of places of belonging.<br><br><em>A Coastline Is an Immeasurable Thing </em>ventures through the physical and mythical landscapes of Daniel's upbringing. Against the backdrop of a migratory adolescence, she reckons with race, religious conflict, culture clash, and a multiplicity of possible identities. Daniel lays bare the lives and legends of her parents and past generations, unearthing the tribal mythologies that shaped her kin and her own way of being in the world. The impossible question of which tribe to claim as her own is one she has long struggled with: the Nigerian government recognizes her as Longuda, her father's tribe; according to matrilineal tradition, Daniel belongs to her mother's tribe, the nomadic Fulani; and the language she grew up speaking is that of the Hausa tribe. But her strongest emotional connection is to her adopted home: California, the final place she reveals to readers through its spellbinding history.<br><br>Daniel's approach is deeply personal: in order to reclaim her legacies, she revisits her unsettled childhood and navigates the traditions of her ancestors. Her layered narratives invoke the contrasting spiritualities of her tribes: Islam, Christianity, and magic. <em>A Coastline Is an Immeasurable Thing </em>is a powerful cultural distillation of mythos and ethos, mapping the far-flung corners of the Black diaspora that Daniel inherits and inhabits. Through lyrical observation and deep introspection, she probes the bonds and boundaries of Blackness, from bygone colonial empires to her present home in America.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/africa"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Africa</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.00</div>",A Coastline Is an Immeasurable Thing: A Memoir Across Three Continents,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">20<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Rob Delaney,"<span class=""Formatted"">A visceral and deeply personal memoir by the star of the Amazon Prime series Catastrophe, about the loss of his young son.<br><br>In 2016, Rob Delaney’s one-year-old son, Henry, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The family had moved from Los Angeles to London with their two young boys when Rob’s wife was pregnant with Henry, their third. The move was an adventure that would bind them even more tightly together as they navigated the novelty of London, the culture clashes, and the funhouse experience of Rob’s fame—thanks to his role as co-creator and co-star of the hit series Catastrophe. Henry’s illness was a cataclysm that changed everything about their lives. Amid the hospital routine, surgeries, and brutal treatments, they found a newfound community of nurses, aides, caregivers, and fellow parents contending with the unthinkable. Two years later, Henry died, and his family watched their world fall away to reveal the things that matter most. <br><br>A Heart That Works is Delaney’s intimate, unflinching, and fiercely funny exploration of what happened – from the harrowing illness to the vivid, bodily impact of grief and the blind, furious rage that followed, through to the forceful, unstoppable love that remains. In the madness of his grief, Delaney grapples with the fragile miracle of life, the mysteries of death, and the question of purpose for those left behind. <br><br>Delaney’s memoir—profound, painful, full of emotion, and bracingly honest—offers solace to those who have faced devastation and shows us how grace may appear even in the darkest times.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography-memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/autobiography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Autobiography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mental-health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mental Health</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.74</div>",A Heart That Works,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,122<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Agatha Christie,"<span class=""Formatted"">First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:<br><br>""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""<br><br>When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/crime"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Crime</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Thriller</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery-thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery Thriller</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.28</div>",And Then There Were None,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,141,809<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Jarek Szubrycht,"<span class=""Formatted"">Dojrzewanie w Polsce lat osiemdziesiątych i dziewięćdziesiątych nie należało do najłatwiejszych, a żeby przetrwać w głównym nurcie, trzeba było dać się ponieść któremuś z potężnych żywiołów: Polskiej Rzeczpospolitej Ludowej, a później chaosowi raczkującego kapitalizmu, albo Kościołowi. A co z tymi, którzy chcieli iść własną ścieżką?<br><br>Jarek Szubrycht od nastoletnich lat wiedział, że jego drogą jest metal. A metal to nie tylko muzyka – to styl życia (skóra i ćwieki na wieki!), dyscyplina sportowa (w której konkuruje się o najbardziej ekstremalne brzmienie, najbardziej radykalne postawy i najbardziej kuriozalne opinie), grupa terapeutyczna (na długo przed internetem) i szkoła kreatywności (bo kto by wiedział, po co się mydli znaczki albo jak wyszywa się logo zespołu na podartej jeansowej katanie?).<br><br><i>Skóra i ćwieki na wieki</i> to dowcipna i błyskotliwa kronika dorastania w „ekstremalnych czasach wymagających ekstremalnych reakcji”, której soundtrackiem jest metal. Szubrycht zręcznie przeplata historie pionierów gatunku ze swoim własnym doświadczeniem fana, redaktora zinów i metalowego wokalisty.

Jennette McCurdy,"<span class=""Formatted""><b>A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life. </b><br><br>Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.<br> <br>In <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i>, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called <i>iCarly</i>, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the <i>iCarly</i> spinoff <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i> alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.<br> <br>Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i> is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mental-health"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mental Health</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/adult"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Adult</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/autobiography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Autobiography</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.61</div>",I'm Glad My Mom Died,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">210,330<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

Aristotle,"<span class=""Formatted""><i>‘One swallow does not make a summer; neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy’</i><br><br>In the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in ‘activity of the soul in accordance with virtue’, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. <i>The Ethics</i> also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle’s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters.<br><br>J. A. K. Thomson’s translation has been revised by Hugh Tredennick, and is accompanied by a new introduction by Jonathan Barnes.

Niccolò Machiavelli,"<span class=""Formatted"">Machiavelli needs to be looked at as he really was. Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term? 1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure. 9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice 10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force. The first is rightly man’s way; the second, the way of beasts.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/political-science"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Political Science</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.83</div>",The Prince,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">305,317<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/philosophy"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Philosophy</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Classics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/politics"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Politics</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">History</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/school"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">School</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literature</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.96</div>",The Republic,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">190,266<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
Elizabeth Gilbert,"<span class=""Formatted"">A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life. <br><br>Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. <br><br>To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. <br><br>An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Nonfiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/memoir"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Memoir</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/travel"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Travel</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Biography</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/chick-lit"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Chick Lit</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/spirituality"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Spirituality</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.61</div>","Eat, Pray, Love","<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">1,644,988<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

After unceremoniously dumping everything in her bag in front of the most attractive man she's ever seen in real life, she arrives at her hotel only to realize she's grabbed the wrong suitcase from the airport.

He grows a handlebar mustache, ditches his signature gray suit, and disguises himself in the bolero-and-cowboy-hat costume of a true “Unitedstatesian”... with varying levels of success, as he continues to be mistaken for either a Dutchman, the wrong writer, or, worst of all, a “bad gay.”<br><br> We cannot, however, escape ourselves—even across deserts, bayous, and coastlines. From his estranged father and strained relationship with Freddy, to the reckoning he experiences in confronting his privilege, Arthur Less must eventually face his personal demons. With all of the irrepressible wit and musicality that made <i>Less</i> a bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-winning, must-read breakout book, <i>Less Is Lost</i> is a profound and joyous novel about the enigma of life in America, the riddle of love, and the stories we tell along the way.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/lgbt"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">LGBT</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/contemporary"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Contemporary</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literary-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Literary Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/humor"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Humor</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/queer"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Queer</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">3.84</div>",Less Is Lost,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">4,259<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

It’s all connected to the horrific death-by-tiger, only the first of several bizarre, mystifying murders being committed by an exquisitely fiendish descendant of Holmes’ Victorian archenemy, Professor Moriarty.<br><br>The tone is classic Holmes -- plus a refreshing twist of fish-out-of-water humor with a surprising spark of real romance.</span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/crime"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Crime</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery-thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Mystery Thriller</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.09</div>",Holmes Coming,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">82<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"

How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)—and use a foolproof method that works every time?<br><br>As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J.

In <em>The Food Lab</em>, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food.

Charles Martin,"<span class=""Formatted""><strong>Combining heart-wrenching emotion with edge-of-your-seat tension, Charles Martin explores the true power of sacrificial love.</strong><br><br><strong>
  <em>He shows up when all hope is lost.</em>
</strong><br><br>Murphy Shepherd has made a career of finding those no one else could—survivors of human trafficking. His life’s mission is helping others find freedom.<br><br><strong>
  <em>But then the nightmare strikes too close to home</em>
</strong><em>.</em><br><br>When his new wife, her daughter, and two other teenage girls are stolen, Murphy is left questioning all he has thought to be true. With more dead ends than leads, he has no idea how to find those he loves.<br><br><strong>
  <em>After everything is stripped away, love is what remains.</em>
</strong><br><br>Hope feels lost, but Murphy is willing to expend his last breath trying to bring them home.<br><br><strong>Preview from Charlie Martin:</strong><br><br>“I don’t know how he does what he does. It sounds rhetorical at this point because I find myself saying the same thing after every book. I flip the last page over (usually after having read it multiple times to prolong the ending) and then say, usually out loud to myself, ‘How the h-e-double-hockey-stick did he just pull that off?’ This book is no exception. It is unequivocally, hands down, a remarkable read. It’s everything you want (and a whole lot more) from a sequel.<br><br>“David Bishop/Murphy Shepherd is the guy who shoots first and asks questions later. He’s got multiple secret identities, flies around on private jets, has several storage units with motorcycles, walls full of well-used handguns, rifles, shotguns, not to mention the storage unit in south Florida where he’s got a Hell’s Bay skiff . . . I mean c’mon. He makes Batman’s arsenal and gadgets look like a joke, and Jason Bourne look like a rookie in the world of taking out bad guys. AND on top of that, the dude’s a PRIEST . . . and he uses his priestly credentials to get in (and out) of some pretty shady situations (spoiler alert) taking out a respectable amount of bad guys in his white robes in the process . . . (spoiler alert #2). Too bad those robes don’t stop bullets . . . (spoiler alert #3 . . . my bad. I’ll stop.) And on top of that, he’s got the world’s greatest dog. The Shepherd/Gunnar duo is unstoppable, again, this time around.<br><br>“But amid all the secret identities and kicking butt he does, let’s face it . . . the dude’s got MAD game. For those who don’t know what that means, the dude is a total chick magnet—and not by choice. And if I can get serious for a minute, <em>The Letter Keeper</em> takes the character development between Bishop and his girls to the next level. By the end, you’re so invested and knitted into their stories and hearts, you’re left scratching your head thinking, ‘Are we sure this is fiction? There’s no way this is made up.’<br><br>“The way he/Dad/Charles walks us through the storyline of Bishop, Summer, and Angel is everything we, us readers, have been waiting for. It’s beautiful and deep and genuine, but thrilling and exciting all in one. Dad/Charles has had a couple of really phenomenal characters break the pages in the last 20+ years of his writing—Matthew Rising, Sunday, Ella Rain (love that lady), Tyler Steele . . . You know ’em, we love ’em all—but these—Bishop, Summer, Angel, Casey, Clay, Bones, yes even Gunnar—might be my favorite. Speaking of Bones, for those who were like me wondering who the heck this guy is in the first book, well, let’s just say there’s more to Bones than meets the eye.<br><br>“Y’all better get ready. Like I said last time, clear your schedule. When this book comes out, say you got a scratchy throat or something, muscle aches, play the COVID scare card for a day and say you need to quarantine. Then read this book . . . front to back. There will be more sweaty palms, fist pumps, tears, and laughter than the first one. I promise.<br><br>“And yes . . . in case you’re wondering . . . by the time this book ends, there’s not much room left on his back for more names. But something tells me that’s not going to stop Bishop.”<br><br><strong>Praise for <em>The Letter Keeper: </em></strong><br><br>“Very few contemporary novelists have found acclaim within mainstream and evangelical markets, but Charles Martin is among them. His latest novel is both a stand-alone story and a sequel to his highly-praised <em>The Water Keeper</em>. It hinges on the Scriptural message of forsaking the found in order to seek the lost, a theme Martin brings to poetic and brilliant life. A man broken by events beyond his control accepts the challenge to walk dark ways in order to bring the lost and helpless home, but he comes close to losing himself in the process. Despite the hardship and heartache, Martin’s story shines with the light of eternal hope.” —<strong>Davis Bunn</strong>, writing for <em>Christianity Today</em><br><br><br>Full-length novel<br>One of the Murphy Shepherd novels:<br>Book One: <em>The Water Keeper</em><br><br>Book Two: <em>The Letter Keeper</em><br><br>Book Three: Available June 2022!<br><br><br>Includes discussion questions for book clubs<br>Also by Charles Martin: <em>The Mountain Between Us</em>, <em>Send Down the Rain</em>, <em>Long Way Gone</em>, <em>When Crickets Cry</em></span>","<span tabindex=""-1""><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genrePlainText""><span class=""Text Text__body3 Text__subdued"">Genres</span></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/christian-fiction"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Christian Fiction</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/suspense"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Suspense</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/christian"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Christian</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/audiobook"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Audiobook</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Romance</span></a></span><span class=""BookPageMetadataSection__genreButton""><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/genres/thriller"" class=""Button Button--tag-inline Button--small""><span class=""Button__labelItem"">Thriller</span></a></span></span>","<div class=""RatingStatistics__rating"" aria-hidden=""true"">4.41</div>",The Letter Keeper,"<span data-testid=""ratingsCount"" aria-hidden=""true"">8,027<!-- --> <!-- -->ratings</span>"
